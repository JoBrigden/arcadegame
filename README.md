## How to play

The player uses the 'left', 'right', 'up', or 'down' key to move the player character around the board. If the player reaches the water (at the top of the board), the player receives a score of 10 points and restarts at the beginning (at the bottom of the board). If the player collides with a beetle, the score is reset to zero and the player restarts at the beginning (at the bottom of the board).

## What to expect

The beetles all start together and then its speeds start to vary. Score increases by 10 points every time you reach the water at the top of the board. The score is reset if the player collides with a beetle.
